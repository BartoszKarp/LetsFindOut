## General Information

LetsFindOut has been divided into two parts: Administrator and User.

As a user, you can not only browse and search for answers. You can also give answers. In addition, you can check which questions have the most answers or which have not been answered.

On the administrator's side, you can check the statistics of answers and questions asked. If you find that a question or category does not meet the requirements, you can: view, edit or delete.

The project is aimed at practical learning, implementing the knowledge gained in Tomasz Woli≈Ñski's courses - JOP (Java from scratch) and EAI (Efficient Internet Applications).
The application is based on the REST architecture and the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) model.
